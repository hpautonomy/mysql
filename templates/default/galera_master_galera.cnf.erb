# The entry below will start a new cluster - once the cluster is bootstrapped,
# it is IMPERATIVE that the blank '"gcomm://"' entry be substituted with the
# actual cluster definition, below, to ensure that if the initiator is ever
# restarted it doesn't attempt to create yet another new cluster, leaving the
# original permanently one node down...
#
# A solution to this is to append the option '?pc.wait_prim=no' to the 'gcomm'
# definition to allow the database to start without active cluster membership,
# but this is limited to 'mysqldump' SST and is apparently still a WIP feature.
